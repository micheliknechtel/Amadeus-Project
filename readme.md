# What is it about ?

It's about a research project we did together with Amadeus, to solve the problem of Worldwide Passenger Flows Estimation.

## Worldwide Passenger Flows Estimation 

This code is a implementation model of the deducting an Origin-Destination matrix from partial data problem. 

The size of the problem we solving here is absolutely huge, this what makes the model attractive.
